# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction
This project predicts the compressive strength of concrete using a hybrid machine learning and deep learning approach. It combines Random Forest, XGBoost, and a custom PyTorch Neural Network, and applies ensemble averaging to improve predictive performance.
